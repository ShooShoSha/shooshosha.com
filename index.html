        <p>I am a developer. Someday, I hope to be a full-stack developer. I have most of the backend technologies learned (ranging from hardware networking, operating systems, database administration, server-side processing, and Windows Form experience for client-facing code. Currently, I am trying to learn more about front-end technolgies focusing on web technologies. I have a decent understanding of HTML and CSS, but JavaScript is where I am weakest.</p>
        <p>I am always willing to learn new technologies, languages, and processes. In fact, I relish the challenge of learning something new. I believe I learn most effectively by doing, so now I am trying to create a website from scratch.</p>
