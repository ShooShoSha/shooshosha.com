        <p>I am a developer. Someday, I hope to be a full-stack developer. I know a bit about:
            <ul>
                <li>hardware</li>
                <li>operating systems</li>
                <li>databases</li>
                <li>server-side processing</li>
                <li>Windows Form experience for client-facing code</li>
            </ul>
            Currently, I am trying to learn more about front-end technolgies focusing on web technologies. I have a decent understanding of HTML and CSS, but JavaScript is where I am weakest.</p>
        <p>I am always willing to learn new technologies, languages, and processes. In fact, I relish the challenge of learning something new. I believe I learn most effectively by doing, so now I am trying to create a website from scratch.</p>
