Main Site
=========

This is a Symfony project (created on June 1, 2016, 12:10 pm) for my personal 
website. It is mostly an experimentation for now as I learn new technologies. 
As a side effect, some projects may stay up if they are good enough. Otherwise,
they will be removed. Since this site (and possbily any other subdomains) is 
version controlled, there will at least be a historical record of my progress.

Configuration
=============

Since there are too many ways of configuring this site, I'll leave it. There's 
no way of knowing what setup I have now will work in the future.
